# Vuejs-Dashboard
Vue Paper Dashboard is a beautiful resource built over Bootstrap and Vue. It will help you get started developing dashboards in no time. Vue Paper Dashboard is a Vue ported version of the Original Paper Dashboard. Using the Dashboard is pretty simple but requires basic knowledge of Javascript, Vue and Vue-Router.
Vue Paper Dashboard was coded by Cristi Jora and the design was made by Creative Tim. It combines soft colors with beautiful typography and spacious cards and graphics. It is a powerful tool, but it is light and easy to use. It has enough features to allow you to get the job done, but it is not crowded to the point where you can't find the files for a specific plugin.

We like consistency and design that blends into its purpose. Vue Paper Dashboard is a perfect example of our most thoughtful work. It combines Vue.js components and plugins, while looking like everything fits together. For an easy start or inspiration for you project, we have also create a set of example pages, like the user settings or usage graphics.

Vue Paper Dashboard is built using the same design language as Paper Kit. You can easily use them together, or pick between them depending on the project you have.

Getting started
Vue Paper Dashboard is built on top of Bootstrap 3, Vue and Vue-router. To get started do the following steps:

Download the project
Make sure you have node.js installed
Type "npm install" in the source folder where "package.json" is located
Type "npm run dev" to start the development server
The repo uses vue-cli scaffolding which takes care of the development setup with webpack and all the necessary modern tools to make web development faster and easier.

Npm tasks:

"npm run dev" - starts a development server on localhost:8080 with live-reload
"npm run build" - builds the app for production with javascript minification and versioning
"npm run unit" - Runs unit tests located under test\unit folder. There are couple of tests written for you to get a better idea on how to run and write Vue unit tests
"npm run unit:watch" - Runs unit tests while listening for any changes in the project. This way you can develop new features and make sure that your old components work as expected without running unit tests every time.
"npm run e2e" - Runs end to end tests. The command and the setup for end to end tests is provided by vue-cli. If you need and have the necessity to write end to end tests, feel free to write them under test\e2e folder
"npm run test" - Runs both unit and end to end tests.
